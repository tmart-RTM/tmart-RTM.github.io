# Instruction - Adjacency-Effect Correction

To be updated...

The code is included in the package and is under testing. I'm currenlty testing it using Sentinel-2 imagery and the results are looking very good for inland and coastal waters. 

If you're interested in knowing more or testing this in your study area, please email me!
