# T-Mart: Topography-adjusted Monte-carlo Adjacency-effect Radiative Transfer Code

## Description 

T-Mart solves radiative transfer in a 3D surface-atmosphere system. It supports customizable surface models and enables simulation and correction for the adjacency effect (AE) in optical aquatic remote sensing. AE correction substantially improves satellite-based retrieval of water-leaving reflectance in nearshore environments (Wu et al., 2024).

## Installation 

1 - Create a conda environment and activate it: 

```bash
conda create --name tmart python=3.9
conda activate tmart
```

2 - Install dependencies: 

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge Py6S
```


3 - Install tmart: 

```bash
pip3 install tmart
```

## Quick start: adjacency-effect correction 

T-Mart supports AE correction for Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat 8/9 OLI/OLI-2 products. Correction is performed directly on level-1 products and can be followed by any amtospheric correction tools. 

Minimal input: 

```python
import tmart
file = 'user/test/S2A_MSIL1C_20160812T143752_N0204_R096_T20MKB_20160812T143749.SAFE'

# NASA EarthData Credentials, OB.DAAC Data Access needs to be approved
username = 'abcdef'
password = '123456'

### Multiprocessing needs to be wrapped in 'if __name__ == "__main__":' for Windows systems, this is optional for Unix-based systems
if __name__ == "__main__":
    tmart.AEC.run(file, username, password)
```

The tool takes approximately 20 min to process a Landsat 8/9 scene and 30 min for a Sentinel-2 scene on an eight-core personal computer. See <a href="https://tmart-rtm.github.io/ins_aec.html" target="_blank">Instruction - Adjacency-Effect Correction</a> for detailed instructions.

## Known issue(s)

`rasterio` version 1.3.11 leads to unprojected S2 image files when performing AE correction in Macâ€™s Terminal. 

- Workarounds: run the code in an IDE, or downgrade to `rasterio` version 1.3.9 for terminal-based workflows.


## Others

T-Mart can calculate reflectances of various units, see Table 1 in Wu et al. (2023) for examples.
